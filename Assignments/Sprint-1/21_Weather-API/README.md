## [Link to PROGRAD WEATHER FORECAST Github Repository](https://github.com/prograd-org/weather-forecast)

We have learned all the important concepts in JavaScript. Now lets work with our project builder in building a smartwatch, applying all of the concepts we have just learned.

### Progression 1: GET THE API

Create an account in (https://openweathermap.org/). Once you create an account, go to settings and get your API.

### Progression 2: WHAT'S THE WEATHER

Use Fetch to fetch the data from openweathermap api and display it as shown in the output.

## OUTPUT

Here is the Screenshot of the Expected Output

Happy Coding ProGrads❤️
