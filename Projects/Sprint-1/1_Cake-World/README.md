### Progression 1: LAYERS

As our first task, we've got to enable the different layers of the cake on the screen. 
Created a `render()` for each ingredient and make sure that it displays the selected layer.

Size of the layer for each crust
```
#layer1{
    width: 245px;
    visibility: hidden;
}

#layer2{
    width: 200px;
    left: 40px;
    visibility: hidden;
}

#layer3{
    width: 160px;
    left: 60px;
    visibility: hidden;
}

#layer4{
    width: 120px;
    left: 80px;
    visibility: hidden;
}

#layer5{
    width: 80px;
    left: 100px;
    visibility: hidden;
}
```

### Progression 2: LAYER THEM UP

Setup `EventListeners`, so that we can add or remove different ingredients by clicking on the respective ingredient buttons. That's the whole point of it.


### Challenge 1: SHOW EM UP

Make the ingredient buttons pop up based on their current active state. This would help customers identify what ingredients they've selected and what's left out.


### Challenge 2: TAKE THE ORDER

Show the customer only the ingredients that they've selected on the chalk board.


### Challenge 3: BILL TIME

The customer has had a good time customizing his cake. Time for him to pay. Use ingredient prices to calculate the cost of a cake and display it to the customer.
