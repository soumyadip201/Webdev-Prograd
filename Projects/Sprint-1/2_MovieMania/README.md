We have learned all the important concepts in JavaScript. Now lets work with our mini project builder in building a movie app, applying all of the concepts we have just learned.

### Progression 1: GENERATE THE API KEY

Create an account in (https://www.themoviedb.org/). Once you create an account, go to settings and get your API key.

### Progression 2: POPULAR MOVIES IN ENGLISH

Use Axios for Fetch to fetch the data from https://www.themoviedb.org/ and display it as shown in the output.

### Progression 3: MULTI-LINGUAL MOVIE DATABASE

Your task is to keep a filter based on the language selected. There should be a minimum of 5 languages.

### Progression 4: UPCOMING MOVIES

Filter out all the upcoming movies.

### Prpgression 5: TRAILERS

Play the trailers of selected movie.

### Bonus: Movie Year

Setup a filter based on the movie year.

## Output

Happy Coding ProGrads❤️
